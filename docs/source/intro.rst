Introduction
============

A unofficial python library to support all of Pexels API features.

- Supports all of the endpoints, which are available in API v1.0
- Return data are python objects.
- User friendly library.
- Easy to use.
  
The Pexels API enables programmatic access to the full Pexels content library,
including photos, videos. All content is available free of charge,
and you are welcome to use Pexels content for anything you'd like,
as long as it is within our Guidelines.

I just wrapped whole API into a Python library, others can use it with ease.
All of the credits goes to the Pexels team for making such big place where free stock photos,
royalty free images & videos shared by creators.
