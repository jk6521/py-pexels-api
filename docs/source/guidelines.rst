Guidelines
==========
Credits
-------

- Whenever you are doing an API request make sure to show a prominent link to Pexels. You can use a text link (e.g. "Photos provided by Pexels") or a link with our logo.

- Always credit our photographers when possible (e.g. "Photo by John Doe on Pexels" with a link to the photo page on Pexels).

Warning
-------

- You may not copy or replicate core functionality of Pexels (including making Pexels content available as a wallpaper app).

- Abuse of the Pexels API, including but not limited to attempting to work around the rate limit, will lead to termination of your API access. 

API Usage
---------

Do not abuse the API. By default, the API is rate-limited to 200 requests per hour and
20,000 requests per month. You may contact us to request a higher limit,
but please include examples, or be prepared to give a demo,
that clearly shows your use of the API with attribution. If you meet our API terms,
you can get unlimited requests for free.

Here are some basic rules to follow when using Pexels content: 

- Identifiable people may not appear in a bad light or in a way that is offensive. This includes, for example, portraying people pictured engaging in criminal activities, suffering from a medical ailment, or in a pornographic context. 

- Don't sell unaltered copies of a photo, e.g. don't sell it as a stock photo, poster, print, or on a physical product without adding any value.

- Don't imply endorsement of your product by people or brands on the image.

- Don't redistribute or sell the photos on other stock photo or wallpaper platforms.
